# HOT OR COLD

Want to play a game? If you've answered 'no', you might be in the wrong place.

Our game is called 'Hot or Cold'. 

You know the drill, the point of the game is to guess a number.

Our target audience are any users with access to the Internet, a bit of a free time, some sense of humour...
...and appreciation for an occasional pop-cultural reference.

Because why? Because we might have hidden a few throughout our sassy game.
